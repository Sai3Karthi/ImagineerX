In today's dynamic work environment, coordinating meetings among team members has become increasingly challenging due to conflicting schedules. To address this issue, there is a need for an application or website that aggregates individual calendars and identifies common available times for scheduling informal meetings efficiently

To run the website, make sure to open the command prompt in the server.js directory and run:
    node server.js

Then run the app.py file, and open the link it gives in the terminal

You will be lead to the register page, where you can register your details.
All the stored users will be in get_calendar_info/testdata.xlsx

Login to enter the home page, which has the following functionalities:
1. Check user availability lets u select a date and time and check if a user(say x) is busy or not at that time. It also displays the list of available users at that time
2. The schedule button displays the data from the excel file on the webpage
3. Last but not the least, New meeting page is an ai page powered by google's gemini, that lets the user select an approximate time. Then the best possible day and time to conduct the meeting will be displayed with the reason.
